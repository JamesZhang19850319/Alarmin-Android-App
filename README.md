##Translations
If you would like to see the app translated to your language, download the English-UK.txt file and translate the text to the right of the colon (:). Keep the following things in mind when doing translations:
* Keep the translation roughly the same or shorter length (open the app to see where the translation need to fit it)
* All "quotations" must stay so that I can directly import the file into the application
* Take note of capitals in the sentences and try to reproduce them in the translation
* New text is always added at the bottom of the English-UK.txt file. If you are updating an existing language, always check that the latest text is at the bottom. If not, simply copy it over and translate.
